# riverwm-friendly-config

### What is it?

This is a user-friendly riverwm shell config that can be used as a good start for **your own** config

It provides:
- Seven config sections (envs, autostart, base configuration, binds, rules, tag settings, other)
- How-to-use instructions in comments (—Åan be useful for new users)
- More user-friendly default keymaps (open a terminal, move windows around, etc...)
- Variables for more convenient use
- And more...

It is based on default shell riverwm config, which locates in /usr/share/river/example/init
